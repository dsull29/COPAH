            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. Ok
                    the 2002 COPAH Luau wasn't that epic but no doubt I'll be telling my grand-kids about it someday. If
                    only to explain how I got skin cancer. Next time you see a fat Irish guy outside in the sweltering
                    sun drunk and shirtless tie him down and put some SPF 2000 on him. He'll thank you later. I really
                    shouldn't complain. What kind of moron complains about beautiful weather? Temps were in the 90's
                    with almost no clouds in Norton that day. Which meant great conditions for being outside drinking
                    beer, eating some BBQ, and chatting with old friends.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chef Tom worked the grill. Serving up his world-famous
                    chicken kabobs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and even a turkey burger or two. Many guests also brought
                    deserts and other dishes. From what I remember all the food was great. Tom's chicken kabobs were so
                    good you had to wait in a line at the grill if you wanted one.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also played some sports. Volley and wiffle ball were
                    heated battles. Most of the volleyball battle was limited to just setting up the damn net though.
                    Wiffle ball went on until well after the sun had set. Oakley was of course the all star here. Nobody
                    has made an art of pitching a wiffle ball quite like Oakley.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there was the drinking. Phipps provided two
                    kegs, one Miller Lite and one Bud Lite. Becky created Tiki Gods to go over the kegs to add to the
                    Luau theme. Tom also rigged up a mini water cooler filled with kamikaze shots, which were strong, a
                    lot too strong. With all this drinking surely there was wacky hi jinx happening. Over the course of
                    the day people were thrown into the pool. This wasn't too big a deal since these people were mostly
                    standing on the pool deck in a bathing suit, but when Moles picked up Becky and threw her in the
                    pool from the ground outside the pool. Well I don't think she was too happy.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the sunset things got blurry. We'll go to random
                    thought mode here.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>People I didn't know and still don't showed up by the carload
                        to play beer pong.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>From what I heard after Fatty is some kind of beer pong master.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>There was a pi�ata filled with candy and nips. Sandy was the big winner with the pi�ata. As it
                        broke all the nips headed in her direction.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>We also celebrated Tom's 24th birthday. Sure it was 11 days early but we had to do something for
                        our host.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>Congratulating myself here for being able to hide it from him all day in his own house.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>The rented karaoke machine never got much play.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>Randy, one of Tom's neighbors treated the crowd to his rendition of the Gwar song "Sick of You"
                        which signaled the end of the night to a lot of people.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <li>Sharon's friend Ivania hates all music.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly that's all I can remember. Maybe I should have
                    written this two years ago.
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end everybody had a great time, except for Ivania.
                    Everybody looked great in their luau get ups. Even if the Hawaiian shirts didn't last 10 minutes
                    before being changed for a t-shirt. I want to thank everybody for coming and making the first COPAH
                    summer party a huge success.
