	    <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;365 Days of a web site.  It started out almost as a joke.  Jay-Ave suggested that someone should get working on it, and a week later Dave emailed him the address.  In the beginning, the COPAH site was just going to be used as a reference tool to get everybody's email addresses and resumes together in order to help each other as we graduated (or attempted to).  This got off to a slow start though, and the resume application never really took shape, evidenced by the fact that to this very day the only two resumes on the site are Dave's and Scrib's.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we realized that the email address database could be better taken advantage of, the object of the site quickly changed as it became used to help organize events and to keep everyone informed of what was going on in the lives of the rest of the COPAH family.  As we found, though, nothing can organize Phipps, as it took about 5 months to get the Fall River faction (Moosh, Jason, Tim, and Adam) on the same page in order to get the Second 45 Tournament together on June 21st 2001 (The first having taken place at UMASS a few years earlier with Scrib and Tim beating the odds and coming out on top).  Not only did this second tournament bring us another member of the COPAH extended family (Keith), but it also brought us the home of many future events, the COPAH Beach House.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turn out for this second tournament was as good as expected seeing as we hadn't heard from anyone in the Taunton faction at this point.  A definite bonus of this tournament was that it brought us the return of the Captain, Jesse Morgan. With a rather confusing format Phipps and Keith managed to win over Tom and Ave in a game that wasn't even supposed to really happen (Tom felt that winning by point differential was un-manly and in the process ending up costing his team $200).  In a fashion that is only his, Bobby Guay called a week later and asked when the tournament was going to happen.  Classic Guay. Simply classic.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks after this tournament, Joe signed up on the site and with him came the rest of the Taunton crew (including Billy, Kim, Scrib, Rob, and Becky), which only meant bigger and better things.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership on the site was up to 20 when we kicked off C.O.P.A.H. Fantasy Football in August 2001. Things were going strong and the family was on the verge of expanding even more. The draft was held at the Charlie Horse in Bridgewater and went pretty well despite an insane drafting order that proved to spread out the talent fairly well.  This was evident in week 15 when there were 7 teams out of 10 that had a shot of making the play-offs.  Tom and Seth had been running 1 & 2 all season till an end of season collapse gave both of them early play-off exits.  This left Scribner and Jay-Ave to battle it out for all the marbles: the 2001 C.O.P.A.H. Bowl Championship, bragging rights, and least of all the money.  Jay-Ave proved his Old Dirty Bastards were no joke by rattling off the highest point total of the season, 196, while Scrib's Roodeepoo Crew only mustered up 104.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the season went so well, plans are currently underway for expansion for next season (possible coaches include are looking to include Josh, Jamie, and AJ), and with the success of Fantasy Football we branched out into Fantasy Hockey and Basketball and I think we're all looking foward to Baseball as hockey and basketball have proved to be unentertaining for fantasy sports.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this was going on throughout the fall and membership achieved it's all time peak, the COPAH family was growing closer and closer, and more events started to come up. Karaoke had come into play and quickly became a family favorite, and another tournament was held. The Cathay Pearl, home of karaoke and performance center for the COPAH Chorus, has proved to be the staging ground for some of Southern New England's worst vocal talents, but hey the alcohol is cheap and the laughs couldn't come any easier.  Typically, trips to karaoke have been made before Monday holidays to give us all a chance to rest up for the work week. The highlights and lowlights are almost too many to mention and besides you really have to see it to believe it. Just as a hint as to what goes on there, Seth and Denio have both sang on stage and danced the night away during some of our times there. If that's not the highpoint of an evening, then I don't know what is.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third 45 Tournament was held on October 27th, 2001 with a full slate of 20 players, including one soccer playing pirate.  The format was simpler, the stakes were higher, and the pain of losing couldn't have been any worse as Phipps and Keith somehow repeated as champions over Seth and a near death Billy.  Phipps doesn't even remember throwing the last card, and we should all be ashamed of ourselves for letting the greatest tragedy in the history of cards take place.
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with all of our additions (AJ, Chief, Sharon) and with all that has occurred in the past year, some might be asking, "What's in store for the next year?" Certainly more karaoke, more fantasy sports, and more 45 tournaments, but there are also some new things on the horizon. A pitch n putt tournament is being talked about, a Hawaiian luau this summer, maybe even a Vegas vacation, and lets not forget Denio and Sandy's wedding (The idea of a C.O.P.A.H. bachelor party is flat out frightening).
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all of these events and future occurrences ahead, the main goal of COPAH will continue to be achieved and nurtured, and that goal is simple: Keep the group together and have a damn good time while we do it!!!!
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whatever is done to preserve COPAH, it's members, and its ideals, it will all be documented right here at good old www.dsull29.com/copah/
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for a great year everyone, and remember, the best is yet to come.
