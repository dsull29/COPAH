                    the first COPAH Innovational 45 Tournament. It was a well devised plan that nearly broke down to a
                    fist fight, but there is no need to dwell on that fact.
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format called for a two bracket first round with the top two
                        teams in each division advancing to play one another. If memory serves me right, and it probably
                        doesn't so somebody please clear this up for me. Dave and Moles won Group A with Adam and Moosh
                        coming in second. They then played Dave and Moles' coming out on top to advance to the finals.
                        The Group B bracket came down to three teams in a tie for second, who knew, so they played the
                        dreaded 6 man game. Scrib and Tim won the division and watched to see who their opponet would be
                        out of Tom and Becky, Morgan and Shaw, and Seth and Guay - who during this game got set on a 20
                        while holding the 5, Jack and Ace of Hearts between them. Tom and Becky smashed the other two
                        teams in 6 hands. Scrib and Tim then took out Becky and Tom. This left Scrib and Tim to face
                        Dave and Moles in the finals. Scrib and Tim won, barely, in a griping 3 game set to be claimed
                        the champions and walk away with the winner's share of the money.</td>
